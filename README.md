# Diverging-Sacked-Bar-Charts-Project
Diverging stacked bar charts address some of the criticism of conventional stacked bar charts, which is that it is challenging to compare the values of the categories in the middle of the stack. They are excellent for displaying the spread of negative and positive values, such as Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (without a Neutral category).
